This is a beta version I put on the mod browser for convenience.

Mod of Redemption is a mod thats getting a big improvement in the full 0.8 update, which will be on 1.4 TModLoader once thats out.
For now you have this, and yes its safe to play (just don't expect multiplayer to be good)

If you've never heard of this mod before and wondering where the version before this is, don't worry about it, this version is better anyway :)

(Also it says 0.8.0.3 because mod browser wont let me publish a new beta with the same version number)

(And if mod browser can't download it, join the discord to get the links)










Cheese.
